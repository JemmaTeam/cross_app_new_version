## Description
Branch which host deployment related resources. This deployment is merely meant for testing and interacting during development, and is specifically done so to enable the client to interact with the app.

## Why?
To enhance the stakeholder feedback loop. Having stakeholders to interact with the app frequently and gaining feedback from them would be ideal ways to ensure that we are
1) on the right track
2) able to find things which can be improved, through the feedback gained.

Note: This deployed version **is not a commercial version**, and only be used for the purpose of gaining feedback from stakeholders.
